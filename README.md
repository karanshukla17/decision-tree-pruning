Binary Classification of the Raisin Dataset using Decision Tree (with Pruning)

Attribute Information:

1.) Area: Gives the number of pixels within the boundaries of the raisin. 
2.) Perimeter: It measures the environment by calculating the distance between the boundaries of the raisin and the pixels around it.
3.) MajorAxisLength: Gives the length of the main axis, which is the longest line that can be drawn on the raisin.
4.) MinorAxisLength: Gives the length of the small axis, which is the shortest line that can be drawn on the raisin.
5.) Eccentricity: It gives a measure of the eccentricity of the ellipse, which has the same moments as raisins. 
6.) ConvexArea: Gives the number of pixels of the smallest convex shell of the region formed by the raisin.
7.) Extent: Gives the ratio of the region formed by the raisin to the total pixels in the bounding box.
8.) Class: Kecimen and Besni raisin.
